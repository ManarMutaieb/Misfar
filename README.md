# Misfar
A review website for Saudi Arabia attractions

# Misfar Presentation

This is the README file for the Misfar project, which is a software engineering project developed for IT 320. The project team members are:
- Ghadeer ALMaymoon
- Randa Bakhashwain
- Manar Mutaieb
- Dhai ALMurshed

The project is supervised by T.Nora Madhi.

## Problem
The problem Misfar targeted was that tourists prefer to read real recommendations written by other tourists. They also want to write their own reviews and share them with their friends. Additionally, tourists need a website to search, view, and write reviews about their traveling experiences.

## Solution
Misfar is a website that aims to be the main resource for travelers interested in visiting Saudi Arabia. It offers a collection of tourist attractions in Saudi Arabia, along with up-to-date tourist reviews on these attractions. The website also features an administration panel for administrators to manage and update the attractions.

## Domain Analysis
The system users of Misfar include **tourists** and **admins**. Tourists require little technical experience, need to read English, and should have a device with an internet connection and a browser. Admins, on the other hand, should have sufficient knowledge about the tourism field and medium technical experience.

## Languages Used
- PHP
- JavaScript
- CSS
- SQL

## System Design
Misfar follows a client-server architecture to ensure efficient communication between clients (users) and the server. This architecture allows for scalability and easy maintenance.

## Conclusion and Future Work
Misfar's plans include expanding to cover all cities in Saudi Arabia, implementing features like liking and replying to specific reviews, and adding videos along with reviews. An app version and additional features related to Saudi seasons and tour planning are also planned.
